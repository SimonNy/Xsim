# Xsim - Further documentation comming soon
**Xsim** is a tool for simulating radiographic planar images of virtual objects under linear motion. The objects are defined in a 3D-grid with values reffering to the material compositions. **Xsim** provides an easy way of examining different X-ray setups for different material compositions. 

The desired object is loaded through the file *loadObject.py* and new objects can be generated with *generateD.py*. 
The X-ray system is defined throught the varibles given in *defineSystem.py*.

The X-ray images is then generated by running *X-sim3D.py*.
